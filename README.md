## Why ##

Nearly all Java text editors, Swing and JavaFX alike, suffer from one deficiency: inability to work with large 
data models, such as logs or query results.

The goal of this project is to provide a professional FX text component that is capable of handling billions of 
lines of text, works with very long lines, provides syntax highlighting, multiple carets and multiple selection, basic text attributes,
embedded images and components, using monospaced font and rendering model.


## Features

* supports up to 2^31 lines of text
* efficiently handles very long lines
* multiple selection and carets
* supports syntax highlight
